    Ever tried working with TCGA mutation datasets? Itâ€™s a real pain in the posterior. Well, this package tries to mitigate the issue by providing pre-compiled, curated somatic mutations from 33 TCGA cohorts along with relevant clinical information for all sequenced samples (from [Broad Firehose](http://firebrowse.org/) and TCGA [MC3](https://gdc.cancer.gov/about-data/publications/mc3-2017) Project)
