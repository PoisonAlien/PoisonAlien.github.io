    <mark>maftools</mark> is an **R** package for analysing data from large-scale cancer genome projects. This package attempts to summarize, analyze, annotate, and visualize [MAF](https://docs.gdc.cancer.gov/Data/File_Formats/MAF_Format/) files in an efficient manner either from TCGA sources or any in-house studies.

    Ever tried working with TCGA mutation datasets? Itâ€™s a real pain in the posterior. Well, this package tries to mitigate the issue by providing pre-compiled, curated somatic mutations from 33 TCGA cohorts along with relevant clinical information for all sequenced samples (from [Broad Firehose](http://firebrowse.org/) and TCGA [MC3](https://gdc.cancer.gov/about-data/publications/mc3-2017) Project)

    Do you like Data Visualization and <mark>Rstats</mark>? This project demonstrates the usage of base R graphics (along with code and datasets) to generate visually appealing plots, without any dependencies whatsoever. I also tweet plots [@baseRgraphics](https://twitter.com/baseRgraphics). Make sure to follow there for updates :)
