    I worked as a lead bioinformatician for Prof. Phillip Koefflerâ€™s lab. A few projects I worked on include deciphering the genomic landscape of hematological cancers (AML, APL, B-ALL), and tumoral heterogeneity in Lung cancer. I assisted post-doctoral research fellows and clinicians in WGS/WXS data analysis/interpretation.

    I worked as a Junior Research Fellow in Dr. Nishant KT's lab. I was involved in the analysis of whole genome sequencing data generated from over 100 yeast tetrads during the meiosis phase. We [measured](https://www.genetics.org/content/199/2/399.long) crossover and gene conversion events by looking at the exchange of SNPs and the effect of a point mutation in *MSH4/5* gene on recombination rate.
