    I worked as a Junior Research Fellow in Dr. Nishant KT's lab. I was involved in analysis of whole genome sequencing data generated from over 100 yeast tetrads during meiosis phase. We [measured](https://www.genetics.org/content/199/2/399.long) crossover and gene conversion events by looking at exchange of SNPs and effect of point mutation in *MSH4/5* gene on recombination rate.
