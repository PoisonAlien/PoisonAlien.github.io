    I am working on Gentics and Epigenetics of [T-Cell Acute Lyphoblastic Leukemia](https://www.leukaemiacare.org.uk/support-and-information/information-about-blood-cancer/blood-cancer-information/leukaemia/t-cell-acute-lymphoblastic-leukaemia/). I use DNA-methylation, changes in histone marks (H3K27ac/H3K4me3/H3K4me1) to study normal T-cell and thereby T-ALL development.

    During my thesis we took silk work pupae, crushed them, fractionated them, extracted fatty content, and converted it into Biofuel! It was kinda cool (but whole lab stinked of dead and dried worms for 6 months). We even won second place in state level competeion.
