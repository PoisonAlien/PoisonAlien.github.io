    I worked on the Genetics and Epigenetics of [T-Cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia](https://www.leukaemiacare.org.uk/support-and-information/information-about-blood-cancer/blood-cancer-information/leukaemia/t-cell-acute-lymphoblastic-leukaemia/) for my thesis. 
    I used DNA-methylation and changes in histone marks (H3K27ac/H3K4me3/H3K4me1) to study normal T-cell and T-ALL development.

    For my thesis, we took silk work pupae, crushed them, fractionated them, extracted fatty content, and converted it into Biofuel! It was a fun project (but the whole lab reeked of dead and dried worms for six months). We even won second place in a state-level competition.
